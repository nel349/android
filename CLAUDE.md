# Midnight Wallet - Claude Context (Auto-Loaded)

**Purpose:** Entry point for all engineering context. Keep this SHORT so it's always loaded.

---

## Core Mission
Build the Midnight Wallet for Android following elite engineering practices.

---

## Engineering Guidelines (Read Based on Task)

**When writing Kotlin code:**
→ Read `guidelines/KOTLIN_GUIDELINES.md`

**When handling crypto/keys/security:**
→ Read `guidelines/SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md`

**When writing tests:**
→ Read `guidelines/TESTING_GUIDELINES.md`

**When building UI/Compose:**
→ Read `guidelines/COMPOSE_GUIDELINES.md`

**When implementing Midnight-specific features:**
→ Read `guidelines/MIDNIGHT_GUIDELINES.md`

## Key Principles (Always Follow)

1. **Explain WHY before HOW** - Don't just write code, explain reasoning
2. **Test-first when possible** - Write test, make it pass, refactor
3. **Security first** - Never log secrets, wipe keys after use
4. **Clean Architecture** - Domain → Data → Presentation
5. **Challenge assumptions** - If something seems off, say so

---

## Implementation Context (Reference When Implementing)

**Investigation Reports:**
- `docs/projects/midnight-implementation-verification.md` - Crypto & transaction flows
- `docs/projects/midnight-deep-dive-round-3.md` - Configuration & state management

**Project Plan:**
- `docs/projects/midnightWallet.md` - Main implementation plan
- `docs/learning/android-weekly-checklist.md` - Progress tracking

## Collaboration Approach

See `LEARNING_STRATEGY.md` for how we work together:
- Learn by doing
- Ask questions when unclear
- Request diagrams/analogies as needed
- You drive the pace

---

## General Instructions

- Always explain the "why" behind decisions
- Use concrete examples
- No generic AI phrasing
- Ask for clarification when unclear
- Reference specific guidelines when making decisions
