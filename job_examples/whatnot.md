This pod works at the intersection of growth, trust, and platform-ization. You’ll be responsible for deeply technical systems (IDV, fraud signal repositories, seller enrichment pipelines, predictive models) that directly influence GMV, seller retention, and buyer trust. The pace is fast: every week, thousands of sellers apply to sell, and your work ensures that Whatnot can confidently scale this influx without compromising marketplace integrity.

We offer flexibility to work from home or from one of our global office hubs, and we value in-person time for planning, problem-solving, and connection. Team members in this role must live within commuting distance of our Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco or Seattle hub.
