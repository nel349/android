About the Role


We’re seeking an exceptional Android engineer to join a small, high-impact team dedicated to creating the world’s most valuable AI application, judged by the impact it delivers to users. You’ll shape cutting-edge mobile experiences, blending technical mastery with a keen product sense to deliver brilliance that resonates with users. An ideal candidate meets at least the following requirements:

Expert in Kotlin, with deep knowledge of Jetpack Compose and the Android View system.

Proficient in performance optimization—memory, CPU, GPU—using low-level tools to deliver blazing-fast systems.

Experienced in designing and shipping intuitive, pixel-perfect mobile UIs that redefine how users interact with AI, driven by a strong sense of product design and user needs.

Skilled in concurrency and reactive programming (Coroutines, Flow) for responsive, real-time apps.

Built high-throughput integrations with APIs (REST, gRPC) or AI model outputs, ensuring seamless data flow while aligning with product goals.

Capable of owning complex features end-to-end, from architecture to Play Store deployment, with a focus on speed, scalability, and delivering measurable user value.


Additionally, experience in any of the following may set you apart:

Deep expertise in the Android ecosystem and related development tools (Android Studio, Gradle, etc.).

Rust for working with our backend components.

Media3 or ExoPlayer for real-time audio processing.

A proven track record of shipping standout apps or features that demonstrate both technical excellence and exceptional product intuition.


What You’ll Do



Dream up and craft delightful, intuitive user experiences that redefine how people interact with AI on mobile, balancing technical innovation with a deep understanding of user behavior and needs.

Obsess over every pixel, animation, and interaction, ensuring the experience feels magical, seamless, and purposeful—delivering joy and utility in equal measure.

Build blazing-fast, highly performant systems where every millisecond counts, while ensuring the product solves real user problems.

Drive technical and product decisions, collaborating with AI researchers, designers, and engineers to deploy state-of-the-art models globally, with an eye toward maximizing user impact.


Who You Are



Technically Exceptional: You possess deep expertise in Android development, particularly with Kotlin. We seek individuals who operate at the highest levels of their craft.

Efficient: You excel at delivering results swiftly, often in a fraction of the time others require. Speed is a core value at xAI—we must act decisively to succeed.

Hardworking

High Agency: You don’t wait for direction—you take initiative, propose bold ideas, and make things happen, both technically and from a product perspective.

Product-Minded: You have a sharp product sense, with an ability to empathize with users, anticipate their needs, and translate that into features that delight and deliver value.
